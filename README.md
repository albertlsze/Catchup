# Catchup
Life gets busy and it is tough to keep in touch with everyone you have met in your walk of life. By helping you randomly select a friend both near and far once a week to contact, you can keep those close connections. Catchup is a simple algorithm to help you keep in touch with friends and family no matter the distance or time!
